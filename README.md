# CancerDiagnosisANN
The aim of this project is to develop and optimize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for cancer diagnosis at MD Anderson Cancer Institute. The model, built using TensorFlow, will assist radiologists in accurately diagnosing cancer based on radiological data, improving early detection and resource allocation.
